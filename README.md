# SIT725
Applied Software Engineering

I would like to inform you that I have configured Git on my personal device, which is linked to my private GitHub account: Savvy9899.

For this unit, I have created the required repository under my Deakin GitHub account and added Savvy9899 as a collaborator. Throughout the semester, all commits and updates will be made through my private account while maintaining the repository under the Deakin account as required.

I trust this approach aligns with the unit requirements, and I appreciate your understanding. Please let me know if you need any further details or adjustments.
